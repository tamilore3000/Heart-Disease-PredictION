# Heart Disease Prediction using Machine Learning

This project provides an advanced machine-learning solution for predicting the presence of heart disease in patients. By analyzing a diverse dataset of health parameters, the project aims to assist medical professionals in making accurate predictions about heart health.

## Overview

The "Heart Disease Prediction using Machine Learning" app offers an intuitive user interface for inputting patient information and receiving predictions instantly. The app employs the following machine learning models to make predictions:

- **Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) Classifier:** A neural network model capable of learning complex relationships in the data.
- **Logistic Regression:** A classic algorithm that models the probability of a binary outcome.
- **Random Forest:** A powerful ensemble model that combines multiple decision trees for accurate predictions.
- **XGBoost:** An optimized gradient boosting algorithm for high-performance predictions.
- **Support Vector Machine (SVM):** A model that finds the best hyperplane to separate data points into different classes.

## Getting Started

To run the app locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository.
2. Install the required dependencies listed in `requirements.txt`.
3. Run the Streamlit app using the command `streamlit run app.py`.

## Usage

1. Open the app in your browser.
2. Input patient information, such as age, sex, chest pain type, and various health parameters.
3. Click the "Predict Heart Disease" button to receive an instant prediction.

## Future Enhancements

The project is open to future enhancements, such as:

- Adding more machine learning models for comparison.
- Incorporating advanced visualization tools for better data exploration.
- Integrating user authentication and security measures.
- Creating a web API for easier integration with other applications.
